rt Parking Sensor System with Raspberry Pi Pico

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the MicroPython code and documentation for a **Smart Parking Sensor + Alert System** built using the Raspberry Pi Pico. This project demonstrates how modern vehicles detect obstacles during parking and provides immediate audio feedback.

Developed as part of my embedded systems journey, this system is a cost-effective solution (under **45 QAR / ~$12.30**) for real-time distance measurement and collision prevention. It's a fantastic example of practical IoT and embedded development for students and hobbyists.

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

In crowded urban environments and tight parking spots, even a basic proximity alert can make a huge difference. This system aims to:
* **Prevent accidental bumps and minor collisions.**
* **Enhance driver awareness** in confined spaces.
* **Lay the groundwork for intelligent automation** in smart parking solutions or robotics.

It offers a practical entry point into embedded development, applicable to smart homes, robotics, or automotive learning scenarios.

## 🔧 How It Works: System Summary

The system is designed for efficiency and clear, immediate feedback:

* **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Used to accurately measure the distance to objects in front of it.
* **Active Buzzer Alert:** Activates with an audible sound only when a vehicle gets too close to an obstacle, providing immediate audio feedback for the driver.
* **Real-time Logging:** Tracks entry and exit times via the serial monitor, allowing for the calculation of total parking duration.
* **MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico:** The entire system logic is programmed in MicroPython, making the code concise, readable, and easy to deploy on the Pico.

## 📊 Behind the Connections: Hardware & Logic

All components connect directly to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

### Hardware Connections:

* **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:**
    * `TRIG` pin connected to `GP3` (Pico Pin 5)
    * `ECHO` pin connected to `GP2` (Pico Pin 4) **via a crucial voltage divider (2kΩ/1kΩ)** to protect the Pico's 3.3V input from the sensor's 5V output.
    * `VCC` pin connected to `VBUS` (Pico Pin 40 - 5V out)
    * `GND` pin connected to any `GND` pin on the Pico (e.g., Pin 38)

* **Active Buzzer Module (3-pin: VCC, GND, I/O):**
    * `I/O` (Signal) pin connected to `GP16` (Pico Pin 21)
    * `GND` pin connected to any `GND` pin on the Pico (e.g., Pin 26)
    * `VCC` pin connected to `3V3 Out` (Pico Pin 36)

**✅ Solved My Challenge: Buzzer Powering Issue**
Initially, I encountered a persistent, continuous sound from the active buzzer module, even when the code commanded it to be off. Through debugging, I discovered that the issue was due to shared power. The resolution involved a key hardware adjustment: I connected the **buzzer module's VCC separately to Pico Pin 36 (3V3 Out)**. Previously, I had connected it to the same VBUS (5V) rail as the HC-SR04. Providing the buzzer with an independent 3.3V supply resolved the unwanted continuous sound, highlighting the importance of isolated and correctly-matched power sources for specific components in embedded circuits!

### System Flowchart (State-Based Logic):

The system follows a simple yet effective state-based logic model:

1.  **Measure Distance** using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
2.  **Evaluate Distance** and trigger actions based on predefined thresholds:
    * `>50cm`: **Buzzer OFF** (No car present or car is far away).
    * `20-50cm`: **Buzzer OFF** (Car is approaching, but not yet in the danger zone).
    * `≤20cm`: **Buzzer ON** (Car is too close! Immediate alert).
3.  **Track Parking Duration:** Records the exact entry and exit times to calculate how long a car was within the monitored zone.
4.  **Serial Output:** All real-time distance data and status messages are displayed on the serial monitor for debugging and monitoring.

This flow ensures the system responds dynamically, transitioning between states with minimal delay, and showcasing essential real-time control logic in embedded systems.
